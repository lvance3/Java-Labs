Answers:

With 1.000 codons generated at 25% chance for each nucleotide to apear, the average occurence of 'AAA' would be 1.56%, or about 15 to 16 out of 1.000.
This is calculated from the probability 0.25*0.25*0.25 = 0.015625 * 100 = 1.5626%
After running the program several times at 1.000 and 10.000 sequences, this rate was true on average.

With the adjusted weights of the nucleotides given, the new occurence of 'AAA' would be 0.17%, or about 2 out of 1000 random codons.
This is calculated from the probability 0.12*0.12*0.12 = 0.001728 * 100 = 0.1728%
After running the program several times at 1.000 and 10.000 sequences, this rate was true on average.
